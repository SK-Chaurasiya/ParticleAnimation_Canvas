# ParticleAnimation_Canvas

We include the Anime.js library using a CDN link.

We create a container div (<div id="particles"></div>) to hold the particles.

Inside a loop, we create multiple particles as <div> elements and add them to the container.

We define the animation properties using Anime.js. The targets property specifies the elements to animate (in this case, all elements with the class 'particle'). We animate the translateX and translateY properties to move the particles randomly around the screen. Other properties control the animation's duration, easing, direction, and more.

The anime.stagger(100) function creates a staggered delay for each particle, so they start their animations at different times, creating a more dynamic effect.

This example creates a simple particle animation where particles move randomly around the screen and alternate directions. You can further customize the animation properties and styles to achieve the desired particle effect.
